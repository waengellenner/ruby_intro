# To run this code, be sure your current working directory

# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos","burritos","nachos"]
# puts favorite_foods.inspect

numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts numbers.inspect

mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array.inspect

shopping_lists = [["milk","eggs","toilet paper"],["soap","shampoo"]]
# puts shopping_lists.inspect

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# puts favorite_foods[-1]
puts shopping_lists[1][0]

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push("more tacos")
puts favorite_foods.inspect

favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["fries", "ramen"]
puts favorite_foods.inspect
puts favorite_foods.count
